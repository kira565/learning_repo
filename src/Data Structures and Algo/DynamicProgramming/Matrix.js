//Matrix
// A matrix is a 2-dimensional array. Questions involving matrices are usually related to dynamic programming or graph traversal.
// Matrices can be used to represent graphs where each node is a cell on the matrix which has 4 neighbors
// (except those cells on the edge and corners). This page will focus on
// questions which don't use matrix as graphs. Questions which are meant to use the matrix as a graph can be found on the graph section.
//Corner cases
//Empty matrix
//1x1 matrix
// Matrix with only one row
